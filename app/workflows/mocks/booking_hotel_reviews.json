I had pre paid the room with my credit card from home but was refused check in until I could produce at least a copy of the card (which I never have on me). This entailed waiting over 20 minutes to access my room. I wasn't offered an alternative solution - such as a different payment method- to speed up check-in. Really disappointing for such a big chain."

Front desk Service was absolutely below par. The stuff is lacking basic communication skills. My wife arrived to the hotel before me. They refused to check her in, despite the fact that our reservation was guaranteed with my credit card and non- refundable. They wanted my wife to pay again for the room and I was asked to send a foto of my Credit Card! by email. Finally we were offered 'free' breakfast as  a compensation. Later I found they charged my card for this. We did not get a receipt when checked out. Horrible experience in 5* Hotel."

Also didn't understand English. When I asked for a blow out, woman had no clue what I wanted. When it was explained to her, she was extremely rude and unprofessional and she absolutely had no clue what she was doing. I don't understand how such incompetence is even employed in a supposed 5 star hotel. Just horrible! "

I know there was some fine print at the bottom of the green option card, but it was so small, I couldn\u2019t read it. But this overall, was only a small issue."
